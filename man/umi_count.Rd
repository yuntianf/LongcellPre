\arguments{
\item{cell_exon}{the input dataframe which includes cell barcode, UMI sequence, isoform and polyA status.}

\item{qual}{The adapter distance from barcode matching to represent the data quality}

\item{bar}{The name of the column to represent cell barcode.}

\item{gene}{The name of column which stores the gene names}

\item{isoform}{The name of the column to represent the isoform.}

\item{polyA}{The name of the column to represent the polyA status.}

\item{sim_thresh}{the minimum threshold of needleman score to connect to different UMIs.}

\item{split}{The character to seperate different exons in the isoform representation.}

\item{sep}{The character to seperate the start and end position of an exon in the isoform representation.}

\item{splice_site_thresh}{The minimum threshold of occurance  for an splice site to be preserved}

\item{verbose}{if print information during UMI clustering for each cell.}
}
\description{
get the umi count for each cell for each gene.
}
\details{
get the umi count for each cell for each gene, the process includes clustering
for UMI and correction for the isoform.
