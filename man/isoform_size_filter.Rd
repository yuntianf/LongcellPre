\usage{
isoform_size_filter(isoforms, size, ratio = 0.1, ..., thresh = 10, eps = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{isoforms}{A string vector, each string represent a corrected isoform by collapse of reads
from the same UMI}

\item{thresh}{The maxmimum threshold of difference for two isoforms to be clustered}

\item{eps}{The maximum threshold of distance to be preserved}
}
\value{
A numeric vector to indicating whether the cluster is filtered out or not
}
\description{
Filter out singletons and small clusters which are not likely to be
correctly clustered, given the distribution of cluster size within a series of isoform clusters.
}
