\arguments{
\item{gene_bed}{The gene bed annotation, should be a dataframe}

\item{genome}{The genome annotation from BSgenome.}

\item{toolkit}{The position of cell barcode and UMI, should only be 5 or 3 end for a library}

\item{map_qual}{The minimum mapping quality of the reads to be extracted}

\item{end_flank}{The maximum threshold for a read to exceed the end of the gene region annotation}

\item{splice_site_bin}{The bin size to correct slice sites given the splice sites annotation from the gene bed}

\item{mid_polyA_bin}{The window size to search for A}

\item{mid_polyA_thresh}{The maximum threshold of the frequency of A in the search window.}

\item{cores}{The number of cores for parallization}
}
\value{
A dataframe including the exons, and polyA existence, each row is a read.
}
\description{
